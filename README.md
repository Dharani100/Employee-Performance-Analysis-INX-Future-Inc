Employee Performance Analysis – INX Future Inc.
Project Overview
The Employee Performance Analysis project aims to predict and analyze employee performance at INX Future Inc. using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to employee performance, predict potential high performers, and support HR strategies for employee development and retention.

Objective
Goal: To build a predictive model to classify employee performance based on historical data.

Techniques Used:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing relationships, distributions, and correlations between features.

Machine Learning Models: Implementing CNN and MobileNetV2 for classification tasks.

Evaluation Metrics: Using accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall to assess model performance.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information about employees, such as demographics, previous performance metrics, job roles, and more.

Target Variable: The performance rating of employees.

Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation.

Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.

TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models (CNN, MobileNetV2).

Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

Machine Learning Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), MobileNetV2.

Performance: Achieved an F1 score of 0.88 with MobileNetV2, outperforming other models like CNN.

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical data.

Normalized or standardized the numerical features.

Model Training:

Trained multiple models, including CNN and MobileNetV2, to classify employee performance.

Applied hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.

Chose MobileNetV2 due to its high performance and efficiency.
